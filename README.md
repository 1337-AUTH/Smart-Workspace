# Smart Workspace

 Welcome to our git repository! Here you will find everything related to the Smart Workspace project that was presented at ECESCON 10. The repository has been updated to include an up to date fritzing diagram of the project and all of its source code. Soon the Blynk configuration, instructions (and a better README) and any other aditional information one might need to utilize a similar setup will be added. Stay tuned!
